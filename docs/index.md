# qualyspy - A Python Package for Interacting With Qualys APIs

This package attempts to make it much easier to interact with Qualys's various API endpoints, across as many modules as I can find time to code.

## Uber Class Example
```py
from qualyspy import TokenAuth, GAVUber

auth = TokenAuth(<username>, <password>, platform='qg1')
uber = GAVUber(auth)

assets = uber.get(
    "query_assets", 
    filter='operatingSystem:"Linux"', 
    lastModifiedDate="2024-06-21"
    )
>>>[AssetID(012345678), ...]
```
## Non-Uber Class Example
```py
from qualyspy.auth import BasicAuth
from qualyspy.vmdr import get_host_list

auth = BasicAuth(<username>, <password>, platform='qg1')

#Pull 4 pages of hosts, with "All/AGs" details & tags:
hosts = get_host_list(auth, details="All/AGs", show_tags=True, page_count=4)
>>>[VMDRHost(12345), ...]
```
