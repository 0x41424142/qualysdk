    :Kwargs:

        action (Optional[str]): The action to perform. Default is 'list'. WARNING: any value you pass is overwritten with 'list'. It is just recognized as valid for the sake of completeness.

Basic includes host ID, IP, tracking method, DNS, netBIOS, and OS. Basic/AGs includes basic host information plus asset group information. Asset group information includes the asset group ID and title. All shows all basic host information plus last vulnerability and compliance scan dates.
