    Get the host list from the VMDR API.
    For a full list of parameters, see the Qualys API documentation: [Qualys API VMPc User Guide](https://cdn2.qualys.com/docs/qualys-api-vmpc-user-guide.pdf)

    Parameters:
        auth (BasicAuth): The authentication object.
        page_count (Union[int, "all"]): The number of pages to get. If "all", get all pages. Defaults to "all".

    :Kwargs:

        action (Optional[str]): The action to perform. Default is 'list'. WARNING: any value you pass is overwritten with 'list'. It is just recognized as valid for the sake of completeness.
        echo_request (Optional[bool]): Whether to show the request. Default is 'False'. ends up being passed to API as 0 or 1.
        show_asset_id (Optional[bool]): Whether to show the asset IDs. Default is 'False'. ends up being passed to API as 0 or 1.
        details (Optional[Union[Literal["Basic", "Basic/AGs", "All", "All/AGs", "None"], None]]): The level of detail to return. Default is 'Basic'. Basic includes host ID, IP, tracking method, DNS, netBIOS, and OS. Basic/AGs includes basic host information plus asset group information. Asset group information includes the asset group ID and title. All shows all basic host information plus last vulnerability and compliance scan dates. All/AGs includes all information plus asset group information: group ID and title. None shows only the host ID (or asset ID if show_asset_id is set to 1 (True)).
        os_pattern (Optional[str]): The OS regex pattern to search for. It follows the PCRE standard, and must be URL-encoded. To match an empty string, use '%5E%24'.
        truncation_limit (Optional[int]): The maximum number of characters to return for each field. Default is 1000, and can be set to 0 for no truncation all the way up to 1,000,000. Past 1M, the API will return an error.
        ips (Optional[str]): Only show assets with certain IP addresses/ranges. Multiple values specified as a comma-separated string. A range is specified with a hyphen. Example: 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.255
        ipv6 (Optional[str]): Only show assets with certain IPv6 addresses/ranges. Multiple values specified as a comma-separated string.
        ag_ids (Optional[str]): Only show assets in certain asset group IDs. Multiple values specified as a comma-separated string. A range is specified with a hyphen. Example: 1-5. A valid ID is required or the API will return an error.
        ag_titles (Optional[str]): Only show assets with specified string in the asset group title. Multiple values specified as a comma-separated string.
        ids (Optional[str]): Only show assets with certain asset IDs. Multiple values specified as a comma-separated string. A range is specified with a hyphen. Example: 1-5. A valid ID is required or the API will return an error.
        id_min (Optional[int]): Only show assets with asset IDs greater than or equal to this value.
        id_max (Optional[int]): Only show assets with asset IDs less than or equal to this value.
        network_ids (Optional[str]): Valid only when the Network Support feature is enabled for the users account). Restrict the request to certain custom network IDs. Multiple network IDs are comma separated.
        compliance_enabled (Optional[bool]): Only show assets with compliance enabled. Default is 'False'. ends up being passed to API as 0 or 1.

        DATE PARAMS

        no_vm_scan_since (Optional[str]): Only show assets that have not been scanned since this date. Formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM:SSZ]' format UTC/GMT.
